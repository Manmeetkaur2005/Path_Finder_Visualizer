# Pathfinding Algorithm Visualizer

A Java-based application that visualizes various pathfinding algorithms (like Dijkstra's, A*, BFS) on a 2D grid. This project was built to demonstrate and understand core concepts from Design and Analysis of Algorithms (DAA).

## 🚀 Features

*   **Interactive Grid:** Create a custom maze by clicking and dragging to draw walls (obstacles).
*   **Algorithm Selection:** Choose from multiple classic pathfinding algorithms:
    *   Dijkstra's Algorithm
    *   A* Search
    *   Breadth-First Search (BFS)
    *  **Real-Time Visualization:** Watch the algorithms explore the grid and find the shortest path in real-time.
*   **Start & End Points:** Easily set the start and end nodes for the path.
*   **Clear & Reset:** Reset the grid to clear paths or walls and start over.

## 📖 How to Use

1.  Launch the application.
2.  **Set Points:**
    *   Select the "Set Start" option and click a cell to place the starting node.
    *   Select the "Set End" option and click a cell to place the target node.
3.  **Draw Walls:**
    *   Select the "Draw Walls" option.
    *   Click and drag on the grid to create obstacles.
4.  **Visualize:**
    *   Select an algorithm from the dropdown menu.
    *   Click the "Visualize!" button to start the animation.
5.  **Reset:**
    *   Click "Clear Path" to remove the visualized path (but keep the walls).
    *   Click "Reset Grid" to clear everything.
5.  **Reset:**
    *   Click "Clear Path" to remove the visualized path (but keep the walls).
    *   Click "Reset Grid" to clear everything.
